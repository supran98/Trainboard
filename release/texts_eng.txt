Throughout recorded time, and probably since the end of the Neolithic Age, there have been three kinds of
people in the world, the High, the Middle, and the Low. They have been subdivided in many ways, they have
borne countless different names, and their relative numbers, as well as their attitude towards one another,
have varied from age to age: but the essential structure of society has never altered. Even after enormous
upheavals and seemingly irrevocable changes, the same pattern has always reasserted itself, just as a
gyroscope will always return to equilibrium, however far it is pushed one way or the other.The aims of
these groups are entirely irreconcilable...

Traditional folk music has been defined
in several ways: as music transmitted orally, music with unknown composers, music that is played on
traditional instruments, music about cultural or national identity, music that changes between
generations (folk process), music associated with a people's folklore or music performed by custom over a
long period of time. It has been contrasted with commercial and classical styles.

We had two bags of grass, seventy-five pellets of mescaline, five sheets of high powered blotter acid, a
salt shaker half full of cocaine, and a whole galaxy of multi-colored uppers, downers, screamers, laughers...
and also a quart of tequila, a quart of rum, a case of Budweiser, a pint of raw ether and two dozen amyls.
Not that we needed all that for the trip, but once you get locked into a serious drug collection, the
tendency is to push it as far as you can.

Well, the way they make shows is, they make one show. That show's called a pilot. Then they show that show
to the people who make shows, and on the strength of that one show they decide if they're going to make
more shows. Some pilots get picked and become television programs. Some don't, become nothing. She starred
in one of the ones that became nothing.

When you're dining in Japan, it's important to never stick your chopsticks into your food to rest them
when you're not eating. This actually resembles a ceremony performed at funerals in Japan, and it's
considered to be a bad omen. For the same reason, it's also taboo to share food with others by passing
it chopsticks to chopsticks. If you want to share, use your chopsticks to place the food on the other
person's plate.
